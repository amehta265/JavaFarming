# JavaFarming
This is a 3 month group project to create a farming simulator/game using concepts of object oriented programming, AGILE, iterative development and unit testing.

We used Package Diagrams, Design class diagrams, use case diagrams, and domain model diagrams to plan, organize, and release 6 iterations of the project where each iteration built on the work of the previous model. Each iteration was also unit tested to check for proper functionality. 

Some features of the farm include:
1. Ability to choose game difficulty, season, and number of players.
2. Ability to manipulate different farm plots through the insertion and removal of multiple crops. Each farm plot can be watered, fertilized, and pesticized. The farm plots also are affected by drought, or "too much rain" each having a particular impact on the crops. 
3. Having an inventory of plants and seeds that the farmer owns.
4. A market place where you can buy and sell a certain number of crops and seeds based on your income. You can hire farm workers to increase your yields as well as farm machinery.
